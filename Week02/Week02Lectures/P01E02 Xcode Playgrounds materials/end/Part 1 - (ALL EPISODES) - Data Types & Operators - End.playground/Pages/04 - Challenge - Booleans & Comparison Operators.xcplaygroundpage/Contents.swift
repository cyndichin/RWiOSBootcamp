/*:
 ## Challenge 1
 
 Create a constant named `myAge` and set its value to your age.

 Then, create a constant named `isVotingAge` that uses Boolean logic to determine if the value stored in `myAge` denotes someone of voting age. In my part of the world, the voting age is 18, so I'll use that here.
*/

// TODO: Write solution here
let myAge = 42
let isVotingAge = myAge >= 18

/*:
 ## Challenge 2
 
 Create a constant named `student` and set its value to your name as a string.
 
 Next, create a constant named `author` and set its value to `"Matt Galloway"`, the original author of these exercises.
 
 Then, create a third constant named `authorIsStudent` that uses string equality to determine if the values of `student` and `author` are equal.
 */

// TODO: Write solution here
let student = "Chris Belanger"
let author = "Matt Galloway"
let authorIsStudent = student == author


/*:
 ## Challenge 3
 
 Create a constant named `studentBeforeAuthor` which uses string comparison to determine if the string value in the constant `student` comes, alphabetically speaking, before the string value in the constant `author`.
 
 The constants `student` and an `author` were declared above in Challenge 3, so you do not need to redeclare them here.

// TODO: Write solution here

let studentBeforeAuthor = student < author
