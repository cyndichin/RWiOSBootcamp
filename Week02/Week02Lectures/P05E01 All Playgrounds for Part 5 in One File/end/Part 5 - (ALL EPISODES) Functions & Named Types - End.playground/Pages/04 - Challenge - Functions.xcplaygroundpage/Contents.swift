/*:
## Challenge 1
 1. Write a function named `printFullName` that takes two strings called `firstName` and `lastName`.  The function should print out the full name defined as `firstName` + " " + `lastName`. Use it to print out your own full name.
 2. Change the declaration of `printFullName` to have no argument label for either parameter.
*/

func printFullName(_ firstName: String, _ lastName: String) {
  print(firstName + " " + lastName)
}
//printFullName(firstName: "Chris", lastName: "Belanger")
printFullName("Chris", "Belanger")


/*:
## Challenge 2
 Write a function named `calculateFullName` that returns the full name as a string. Use it to store your own full name in a constant.
*/

func calculateFullName(_ firstName: String, _ lastName: String) -> String {
  return firstName + " " + lastName
}
let fullName = calculateFullName("Chris", "Belanger")
